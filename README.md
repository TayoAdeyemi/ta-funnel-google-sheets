# Recruiting Funnel & Time-to-Hire Analysis

This project looks at a recruiting funnel to understand how candidates move from applying to being hired.

I am using Google Sheets to analyze where candidates drop off, where the process slows down, and how long it takes to hire someone.

The goal of this project is to practice basic data analysis skills and clearly explain findings in a way that non-technical people can understand.

The data used in this project is sample data and does not contain any real candidate information.

More analysis, charts, and documentation will be added as the project progresses.
